SEO Implementation:

1: Use of LSI keyword in title tag, Description tag and Header Tag = {recipes with picture, recipes for dinner, easy comfort recipe, winter comfort recipe, healthy recipes, recipes for kids }
2 : Link Building : Internal Link --->  "Get Recipe" on Recipes Page
                    External Link ----> "Register Now" on events page . It will direct to event website. But as I no actual link I have used #.
